## Project description
A typical airline booking flow:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. Enter billing information

Step 4 would be done via integration of something like Paypal, via a gem or an SDK or Stripe.
